# Chess Club API exercise

## Description

This is a small exercise about fetching data using axios and applying pagination to the data acquired.
You can see the many chess clubs to which users are affiliated to. Me suggestion, search for mick, laura
and richard and watch the different clubs they belong to.

## Challenges about this exercise

The biggest challenge was the implementation of useReduce() as it seems like a tricky hook, i will have more
practice with it in the future.

## Future work

I wish to change the focus of this exercise to a music catalog (that is more appealing to me) as i couldn't
get access to the music API in time for this exercise.
